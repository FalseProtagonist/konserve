[*Simple durability, made flexible.*](https://whilo.github.io/articles/16/unified-storage-io)

A simple document store protocol defined with [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) semantics to allow Clojuresque collection operations on associative key-value stores, both from Clojure and ClojureScript for different backends. Data is generally serialized with [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) semantics or, if supported, as native binary blobs and can be accessed similar to `clojure.core` functions `get-in`,`assoc-in` and `update-in`. `update-in` especially allows to run functions atomically and returns old and new value. Each operation is run atomically and must be consistent (in fact ACID), but further consistency is not supported (Riak, CouchDB and many scalable solutions don't have transactions over keys for that reason). This is meant to be a building block for more sophisticated storage solutions (Datomic also builds on kv-stores). An append-log for fast writes is also implemented.

## Features
- *cross-platform* between Clojure and ClojureScript (including node.js)
- *lowest-common denominator interface* for an associative datastructure with `edn` semantics
- *thread-safety with atomicity over key operations*
- *consistent error handling* for core.async
- *fast serialization* options (fressian, transit, ...), independent of the underlying kv-store
- *very low overhead* protocol, including direct binary access for high throughput
- *no additional dependencies and setup* required for IndexedDB in the browser and
  the file backend on the JVM
- *avoids blocking io*, the filestore for instance will not block any thread on
  reading. Fully asynchronous support for writing and other stores is in the
  pipeline.


## Supported Backends

A file-system store in Clojure and [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB) for ClojureScript are provided as elementary reference implementations for the two most important platforms. No setup and no additional dependencies are needed.

### fs-store
The file-system store currently uses [fressian](https://github.com/clojure/data.fressian) in Clojure and [fress](https://github.com/pkpkpk/fress) in ClojureScript and is quite efficient. Both implementations use the same on-disk format and can load the same store (but not concurrently). It also allows to access values as a normal file-system file, e.g. to open it with a native database like HDF5 in Java. You can decide not to fsync on every write by a configuration of `{:fsync false}`, if a potential but unlikely data loss is not critical for you (e.g. for a session store).


### IndexedDB
For IndexedDB there is no internal JSON-representation of the underlying store like [transit](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-clj) yet, hence it is fairly slow for edn still. There is a JSON store protocol implemented for IndexedDB in case interoperability with a JavaScript application is wanted. Be careful not to confuse values with edn values, they are stored in separate locations and cannot clash.

### External Backends

- LevelDB: [konserve-leveldb](https://github.com/replikativ/konserve-leveldb).
- CouchDB: [konserve-clutch](https://github.com/replikativ/konserve-clutch).
- Redis: [konserve-carmine](https://github.com/replikativ/konserve-carmine).
- Riak: [konserve-welle](https://github.com/replikativ/konserve-welle).
- PostgreSQL: [konserve-pg](https://github.com/retro/konserve-pg).

New storage backends, e.g. MongoDB, JDBC, WebSQL, Local-Storage are welcome.

There is also a [system component](https://github.com/danielsz/system/blob/master/src/system/components/konserve.clj) for the internal backends.

## Projects building on konserve
- The protocol is used in production and originates as an elementary storage protocol for [replikativ](https://github.com/replikativ/replikativ).
- [kampbell](https://github.com/danielsz/kampbell) maps collections of entities to konserve and enforces specs.

## Benchmarks

Due to its simplicity it is also fairly fast as it directly serializes Clojure, e.g. with fressian, to durable storage. The file-store is CPU bound atm. More detailed benchmarks are welcome :).

~~~clojure
  (let [numbers (doall (range 1024))]
    (time
     (doseq [i (range 1000)]
       (<!! (assoc-in store [i] numbers)))))
  ;; fs-store: ~7.2 secs on my old laptop
  ;; mem-store: ~0.186 secs

  (let [numbers (doall (range (* 1024 1024)))]
    (time
     (doseq [i (range 10)]
       (<!! (assoc-in store [i] numbers)))))
  ;; fs-store: ~46 secs, large files: 1 million ints each
  ;; mem-store: ~0.003 secs
~~~

It is not necessarily fast depending on the usage pattern. The general idea is to write most values once (e.g. in form of index fragments) and only update one place once all data is written, similar to Clojure's persistent datastructures and balanced trees. To store values under non-conflicting keys, have a look at [hasch](https://github.com/replikativ/hasch).


## Combined usage with other writers

konserve assumes currently that it accesses its keyspace in the store exclusively. It uses [hasch](https://github.com/replikativ/hasch) to support arbitrary edn keys and hence does not normally clash with outside usage even when the same keys are used. To support multiple konserve clients in the store the backend has to support locking and proper transactions on keys internally, which is the case for backends like CouchDB, Redis and Riak.


## Serialization formats

Different formats for `edn` serialization like [fressian](https://github.com/clojure/data.fressian), [transit](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/7/22/transit) or a simple `pr-str` version are supported and can be combined with different stores. Stores have a reasonable default setting. You can also extend the serialization protocol to other formats if you need it. You can provide [incognito](https://github.com/replikativ/incognito) support for records, if you need them.

### Tagged Literals

You can read and write custom records according to [incognito](https://github.com/replikativ/incognito).


## Usage

Add to your leiningen dependencies:
[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/io.replikativ/konserve/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/io.replikativ/konserve)

From a Clojure REPL run:
~~~clojure
(ns test-db
    (:require [konserve.filestore :refer [new-fs-store]]
              [konserve.core :as k]
              [clojure.core.async :as async :refer [<!!]]))


;; Note: We use the thread blocking operations <!! here only to synchronize
;; with the REPL. <!! is blocking IO and does not compose well with async
;; contexts, so prefer composing your application with go and <! instead.

(def store (<!! (new-fs-store "/tmp/store")))

(<!! (k/assoc-in store ["foo" :bar] {:foo "baz"}))
(<!! (k/get-in store ["foo"]))
(<!! (k/exists? store "foo"))

(<!! (k/assoc-in store [:bar] 42))
(<!! (k/update-in store [:bar] inc))
(<!! (k/get-in store [:bar]))
(<!! (k/dissoc store :bar))

(<!! (k/append store :error-log {:type :horrible}))
(<!! (k/log store :error-log))

(let [ba (byte-array (* 10 1024 1024) (byte 42))]
  (time (<!! (k/bassoc store "banana" ba))))
(<!! (k/bget store "banana" (fn [{is :input-stream}] (go (your-read-does-all-work-here is)))))
~~~


In a ClojureScript REPL you can evaluate the expressions from the REPL each
wrapped in a go-block.

For simple purposes a memory store wrapping an Atom is implemented as well:
~~~clojure
(ns test-db
  (:require [konserve.memory :refer [new-mem-store]]
            [konserve.core :as k]))

(go (def my-db (<! (new-mem-store)))) ;; or
(go (def my-db (<! (new-mem-store (atom {:foo 42})))))
~~~


In ClojureScript from a browser (you need IndexedDB available in your js env):
~~~clojure
(ns test-db (:require [konserve.indexeddb :refer [new-indexeddb-store]])
(:require-macros [cljs.core.async.macros :refer [go go-loop]]))

(go (def my-db (<! (new-indexeddb-store "konserve"))))

(go (println "get:" (<! (k/get-in my-db ["test" :a]))))

(go (doseq [i (range 10)]
       (<! (k/assoc-in my-db [i] i))))

;; prints 0 to 9 each on a line
(go (doseq [i (range 10)]
      (println (<! (k/get-in my-db [i])))))

(go (println (<! (k/assoc-in my-db ["test"] {:a 1 :b 4.2}))))

(go (println (<! (k/update-in my-db ["test" :a] inc))))
;; => "test" contains {:a 2 :b 4.2}
~~~

For non-REPL code execution you have to put all channel operations in one
top-level go-block for them to be sychronized:
~~~clojure
(ns test-db (:require [konserve.indexeddb :refer [new-indexeddb-store]])
(:require-macros [cljs.core.async.macros :refer [go go-loop]]))

(go (def my-db (<! (new-indexeddb-store "konserve")))

    (println "get:" (<! (k/get-in my-db ["test" :a])))

    (doseq [i (range 10)]
       (<! (k/assoc-in my-db [i] i))))
~~~

For more examples have a look at the comment blocks at the end of the respective namespaces.

## JavaScript bindings

There are experimental javascript bindings in the `konserve.js` namespace:

~~~javascript
goog.require("konserve.js");

konserve.js.new_mem_store(function(s) { store = s; });
# or
konserve.js.new_indexeddb_store("test_store", function(s) { store = s; })

konserve.js.exists(store, ["foo"], function(v) { console.log(v); });
konserve.js.assoc_in(store, ["foo"], 42, function(v) {});
konserve.js.get_in(store,
                   ["foo"],
                   function(v) { console.log(v); });
konserve.js.update_in(store,
                      ["foo"],
                      function(v) { return v+1; },
                      function(res) { console.log("Result:", res); });
~~~

## Release
Konserve follows the replikativ release workflow. Commits on the branch development trigger a
test/build/release-pipeline on CircleCI and deploy a SNAPSHOT to Clojars. Commits on master
trigger a test/build/release-pipeline on CircleCI and deploy a release to Clojars.

More details are [written down in the Datahike repository](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike/blob/development/doc/release.md).
